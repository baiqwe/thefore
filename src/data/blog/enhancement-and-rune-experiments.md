# The Forge (Roblox) Enhancement Guide: Runes & Upgrading Strategy

**Want to turn good gear into god-tier equipment?** You need to master the Enhancement and Rune systems.

In **The Forge on Roblox**, crafting a weapon is just the beginning. The real power comes from upgrading it. But be warned: this system is high-risk, high-reward.

I've broken countless swords learning these lessons so you don't have to.

---

## The Basics of Enhancement

Enhancement increases your equipment's base stats (Damage for weapons, Defense for armor).

You'll need **Enhancement Stones**, which drop from [dungeon bosses](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide) or can be crafted from ore dust.

### Success Rates & Risks

The higher you go, the harder it gets.

| Level | Success Rate | Failure Consequence |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| +1 to +3 | 100% | None |
| +4 to +6 | 70% | Downgrade (-1 Level) |
| +7 to +9 | 40% | Reset to +0 |
| +10+ | 15% | **Item Destruction** |

> **Warning:** Never attempt +10 on your main weapon without a Protection Scroll. Losing your [Legendary Arcane Pickaxe](/blog/legendary-arcane-pickaxe-guide) is a pain you don't want to feel.

## The Rune System Explained

Runes add special effects to your gear. Unlike enhancements, runes don't break your item, but they can overwrite existing slots.

### Common Rune Types

| Rune | Effect | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Ignis (Fire)** | Burn damage over time | [Katana builds](/blog/weapon-mastery-katana-greatsword) |
| **Terra (Earth)** | Increased durability | Mining tools |
| **Ventus (Wind)** | Attack speed boost | Fast weapons |
| **Aqua (Water)** | Stamina regeneration | [Heavy Armor](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) |

### Rune Synergy

Some runes work better together.

- **Fire + Wind:** Fast attacks stack burn damage rapidly.
- **Earth + Water:** Maximum sustainability for long [mining sessions](/blog/my-blacksmith-journey-begins).

## My "Safe Upgrade" Strategy

Gambling is fun, but losing gear isn't. Here is my risk-averse method for consistent power gains.

### Phase 1: The Safe Zone (+1 to +6)
Spam basic Enhancement Stones. Even if you fail at +5, you only drop to +4. It's cheap and easy.

### Phase 2: The Danger Zone (+7 to +9)
Use **Lucky Powders**. These consumables increase success chance by 15%.

- **Cost:** 5,000 Gold each
- **Value:** Saves you from resetting to +0

Is it worth it? Yes. Re-leveling from +0 costs way more than 5,000 gold in materials.

### Phase 3: The God Tier (+10 and beyond)
**Rule:** Never attempt this without a **Protection Scroll**.

These scrolls are rare drops from the [Forgotten Kingdom](/blog/portal-adventure-forgotten-kingdom) or cost a fortune in the [trading market](/blog/advanced-trading-secrets).

If you can't afford the scroll, stay at +9. A +9 weapon is better than a broken pile of scrap.

## Economic Analysis of Upgrading

Is it cheaper to buy pre-upgraded gear or upgrade it yourself?

**My Data:**
- **Buying +9 Sword:** 250,000 Gold
- **Crafting & Upgrading yourself:** ~180,000 Gold (average luck)

**Verdict:** DIY is cheaper *on average*, but you risk bad RNG. If you have bad luck, just buy it.

## Advanced Rune Combinations

For endgame players, simple runes aren't enough. You need **Ancient Runes**.

These combine two effects but are incredibly rare.

| Ancient Rune | Effects | Drop Location |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| **Volcanic** | Fire Dmg + Explosion Chance | [Fire Dungeon](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide) |
| **Glacial** | Ice Dmg + Slow Effect | Ice Caverns |
| **Storm** | Lightning Dmg + Stun | Mountain Peak |

I use a **Volcanic Rune** on my Greatsword. The explosion proc clears groups of mobs instantly.

## Common Enhancement Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Upgrading Trash Gear
Don't waste +6 stones on a Common Iron Sword. Save your resources for at least Rare or Epic quality gear.

### Mistake 2: Rage Enhancing
You fail a 70% roll. You get mad. You click again instantly. You fail again.

**Stop.** Take a breath. The RNG doesn't care about your feelings.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Durability
Enhanced items degrade faster. If you don't have the repair funds, that +9 sword will become useless quickly.

## Your Upgrade Roadmap

**Level 1-20:**
- Stick to +3 gear
- Save all Enhancement Stones

**Level 21-40:**
- Aim for +6 on main weapon
- Use basic runes (Terra/Ventus)

**Level 41+:**
- Push for +9
- Hunt for Ancient Runes
- Optimize [race bonuses](/blog/quest-for-dragonborn-bloodline) for your build

## Final Thoughts

The Enhancement system is the true endgame of The Forge. It separates the casuals from the legends.

Respect the odds. Protect your gear. And may the RNG gods smile upon your anvil.
