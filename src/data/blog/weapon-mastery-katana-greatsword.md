# The Forge (Roblox) Weapon Guide: Katana vs. Greatsword Mastery

**Speed or Power?** It's the ultimate question.

In **The Forge on Roblox**, your weapon defines your playstyle. While there are many options, two dominate the meta: the swift **Katana** and the crushing **Greatsword**.

I've mastered both to Level 100. Here is the definitive breakdown to help you choose.

## Weapon Comparison

### The Tale of the Tape

| Feature | Katana | Greatsword |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Damage per Hit** | Moderate | **Massive** |
| **Attack Speed** | **Very Fast** | Slow |
| **Mobility** | High (Dash) | Low (Heavy) |
| **Range** | Short | Long (Wide Arc) |
| **Best For** | Single Target / Bosses | Crowd Control / Farming |

## The Katana: Dance of Death

The Katana is for players who value precision and evasion.

**Playstyle:** Hit, dash, hit, dash. You never stand still.

### Key Mechanics
- **Bleed Effect:** Every 3rd hit applies Bleed. Stacks up to 5 times.
- **Dash Strike:** Special move that dashes through enemies, dealing damage and dodging attacks.

**Best Race Synergy:**
- **Elf:** Movement speed bonus makes you untouchable.
- **Dragonborn:** Fire bonus adds burn to your bleed. (See [Race Guide](/blog/quest-for-dragonborn-bloodline)).

**Strategy:** Use this for [Dungeon Bosses](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide). You can dodge their heavy attacks while keeping up DPS.

## The Greatsword: Cleaving the Earth

The Greatsword is for players who want to delete groups of enemies in one swing.

**Playstyle:** Group them up, charge up, destroy them.

### Key Mechanics
- **Super Armor:** You cannot be interrupted while swinging.
- **Cleave:** Hits all enemies in a 180-degree arc.
- **Stun:** Heavy attacks have a chance to stun.

**Best Race Synergy:**
- **Undead:** You will take hits while charging. The extra defense is vital.
- **Orc:** Raw strength bonus scales well.

**Strategy:** Use this for farming [The Forgotten Kingdom](/blog/portal-adventure-forgotten-kingdom). You can clear 5 mobs in the time a Katana kills 2.

## How to Level Weapon Mastery Fast

Mastery unlocks new skills. You need to level it up.

**The XP Formula:** XP is based on *damage dealt*, not kills.

**Fastest Method:**
1. Find a high-HP boss (like a Golem).
2. Use a low-damage training weapon.
3. Hit it hundreds of times.

You get more XP per minute hitting a damage sponge than chasing weak goblins.

---

## Hybrid Builds?

Can you use both? Yes.

**The "Switch" Tech:**
1. Use **Greatsword** to clear the small mobs.
2. Switch to **Katana** when the Boss appears.

This requires keeping two weapons upgraded, which is expensive. Check my [Gold Guide](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) to fund this lifestyle.

---

## Recommended Enhancements

Don't forget to upgrade.

- **Katana:** Needs **Ventus (Wind)** runes for attack speed.
- **Greatsword:** Needs **Ignis (Fire)** or **Terra (Earth)** for raw damage/durability.

See the [Enhancement Guide](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments) for details.

## Final Thoughts

There is no "wrong" choice.

If you like feeling like a ninja, pick the Katana.
If you like feeling like a juggernaut, pick the Greatsword.
