# The Forge (Roblox) Boss Guide: Combat Gimmicks & Rune Drops

**Why am I doing zero damage?**

Friends, I was struggling with combat in **The Forge on Roblox**. I'd hack-and-slash through normal enemies, but when I faced a proper Boss, I'd get demolished.

I quickly realized that bosses here aren't simple HP sponges. They are puzzle challenges with a core **"Gimmick."**

I had to study combat logs and advanced guides to survive. Here is how to deconstruct the challenges.

## The Stone Golem: The Armor Phase

My first brutal lesson. My mighty [Greatsword](/blog/weapon-mastery-katana-greatsword) was barely scratching it.

**The Gimmick:**
The Golem has a near-impenetrable "Armor Phase" where damage is reduced by 90%.

**The Solution:**
Wait for the **Seismic Slam**. When it raises its arm, it exposes a glowing, soft weak point on its back.

**My Strategy:**
1. Wait for the slam animation.
2. Dodge Roll behind it.
3. Unleash a focused combo on the weak spot.

I no longer attack wildly. I wait for the **Vulnerability Window**.

## The Flame Hound: Elemental Counters

This boss was burning me alive.

**The Gimmick:**
High fire resistance and constant burn aura.

**The Solution:**
I found an article explaining it is extremely vulnerable to **Frost Damage**.

I temporarily put aside my favorite fire-enchanted Katana and crafted a cheap **Ice-Runed Dagger**.
- **Result:** Massive damage multiplier.
- **Lesson:** The game rewards strategic preparation.

Check my [Enhancement Guide](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments) for how to craft elemental runes.

## The Shadow Wraith: The Light Totem

The most challenging gimmick I've mastered so far.

**The Gimmick:**
The Wraith has an "Invulnerability Phase" where it becomes a swirling shadow. You cannot hit it.

**The Solution:**
You MUST place a **Light Totem** nearby (crafted by Engineers).
- The light forces the Wraith to materialize.
- Without the totem, you simply cannot win.

This requires preparation before you even enter the [Dungeon](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide).

## Rune Drop Optimization

I also learned that each Boss guarantees a higher chance of dropping specific Runes.

### Boss Loot Table

| Boss | Primary Rune Drop | Best For |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Goblin King** | **Gold Gain Rune** | [Farming Wealth](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) |
| **Stone Golem** | **Defense Rune** | Tank Builds |
| **Flame Hound** | **Ignis (Fire) Rune** | DPS Weapons |
| **Shadow Wraith** | **Celerity (Speed) Rune** | [Mining Speed](/blog/legendary-arcane-pickaxe-guide) |

This knowledge lets me target the boss that directly feeds into my current build needs.

## The Tactician's Mindset

This deep dive into mechanics changed my perception.

It's not about being the strongest; it's about being the smartest. I feel like a tactician now, breaking down each enemy into its component weaknesses.

Every successfully defeated boss is a triumph of strategy over brute force.
