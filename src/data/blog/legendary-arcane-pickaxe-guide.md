# The Forge (Roblox) Crafting Guide: Legendary Arcane Pickaxe

**The ultimate tool for the ultimate blacksmith.**

In **The Forge on Roblox**, the **Legendary Arcane Pickaxe** is the status symbol. It glows purple, mines instantly, and doubles your ore yield.

But getting it? That's a journey.

I spent 2 weeks grinding for this item. Here is the complete roadmap so you can do it in 3 days.

---

## Stats & Benefits

Why is it worth the grind?

| Stat | Iron Pickaxe | Arcane Pickaxe |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Mining Speed** | 100% | **350%** |
| **Durability** | 500 | **5,000** |
| **Special Effect** | None | **Double Ore Chance (20%)** |
| **Enchant Slots** | 1 | **3** |

It pays for itself in one day of mining [Mithril](/blog/portal-adventure-forgotten-kingdom).

## Step 1: The Blueprint

You can't craft it without the recipe.

- **Location:** Sold by the **Grandmaster Smith** in High Forge City.
- **Requirement:** 5,000 Reputation Points.
- **Cost:** 100,000 Gold.

See my [Reputation Guide](/blog/reputation-quests-blueprint-shop) on how to farm rep fast.

## Step 2: Gathering Materials

This is the hard part. You need rare drops from three different zones.

### Material Checklist

| Material | Quantity | Location | Difficulty |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Arcane Ore** | 50 | Forgotten Kingdom (Deep) | High |
| **Void Crystal** | 5 | [Crypt Lord Boss](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide) | Extreme |
| **Star Metal** | 10 | Meteor Events (Night only) | Medium |
| **Magic Handle** | 1 | Crafted (Wood + Mana Dust) | Low |

> **Pro Tip:** Use a **Recall Scroll** immediately after finding Arcane Ore. If you die, you lose it.

---

## Step 3: The Perfect Smelt

You cannot use Coal for this. You MUST use **Arcane Essence** (crafted from Magic Dust).

- **Temperature Window:** Extremely small (Golden Zone is 5 pixels wide).
- **Risk:** If you burn Arcane Ore, you have to farm it again.

**Recommendation:** Practice on Mithril first. If you can't hit 10/10 Perfect Mithril smelts, don't touch the Arcane Ore yet. Read my [Temperature Guide](/blog/furnace-temperature-mastery).

---

## Step 4: The Forging Ritual

This isn't a normal craft. It's a boss fight against the anvil.

1. **Go to the Ancient Anvil** in the Forgotten Kingdom. (Regular anvils won't work).
2. **Start the Minigame:** It's faster and harder than normal.
3. **Perfect Strikes:** You need at least 90% Perfect Strikes to get "Legendary" quality.

If you fail the minigame, you get an "Epic" version. Still good, but not Legendary.

> **Team Strategy:** Bring a **Bard** (support class) to buff your focus before you start.

---

## Step 5: Enchanting

Once crafted, don't stop there.

**Best Runes for Arcane Pickaxe:**
1. **Terra (Earth):** Unbreaking durability.
2. **Fortuna (Luck):** Increases double ore chance to 30%.
3. **Celerity (Speed):** Makes mining instant.

## Final Thoughts

Holding the Arcane Pickaxe for the first time is the best feeling in The Forge. You are no longer a novice. You are a Master Smith.

Good luck with the Void Crystals. You'll need it.
