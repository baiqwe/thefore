# The Forge (Roblox) Reputation Guide: Blueprint Shop & Quests

**Gold can't buy everything.**

In **The Forge on Roblox**, the most powerful items are locked behind **Reputation**. You can have a million gold, but if the Grandmaster Smith doesn't respect you, he won't sell you the good stuff.

Here is how to grind Reputation fast and unlock the endgame.

## The Reputation Tiers

Your status determines what you can buy.

## How to Earn Reputation

There are three ways to gain Rep.

### 1. Daily Quests (Slow & Steady)
Sensei Moro offers 3 quests per day.
- **Rewards:** 50-100 Rep each.
- **Tasks:** "Mine 50 Iron", "Craft 10 Swords".
- **Strategy:** Do these every day. It takes 15 minutes.

### 2. Community Orders (Fastest)
The "Request Board" in town lists items that NPCs need.
- **Task:** "Deliver 5 Heavy Chestplates".
- **Reward:** 500 Rep + Gold.
- **Strategy:** Use my [Heavy Armor Crafting](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) method to mass-produce these items.

### 3. Boss Trophies (Big Bursts)
Turning in a boss trophy (like the [Magma Core](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide)) gives 1,000 Rep.
- **Limit:** Once per boss per week.

## The Advanced Mold Shop (Formerly Blueprints)

Located in High Forge City. This is where you purchase **Specialty Molds** that allow you to craft specific weapon types more efficiently or unlock entirely new categories.

### Must-Buy Unlocks

1.  **Ore Import License (Tier 2):** Allows you to buy [Cobalt and Titanium](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) directly from NPCs.
2.  **Conveyor Belt (Tier 3):** Essential for automating your ore sorting.
3.  **Specialty Katana Mold (Tier 3):** Reduces the weight requirement for Katanas by 10%.
4.  **Masterwork Pickaxe Mold (Tier 4):** The only way to craft the [Arcane Pickaxe](/blog/legendary-arcane-pickaxe-guide).

## Hidden Reputation Bonuses

You can speed this up.

- **Human Race:** Passive +10% Reputation gain. (See [Race Guide](/blog/quest-for-dragonborn-bloodline)).
- **Guild Bonus:** Joining a Level 10 Guild gives +5% Rep.
- **Charisma Potion:** Drink before turning in quests for +20% Rep.

> **Math:** If you turn in a 500 Rep quest as a Human with a Potion, you get **650 Rep**. That saves you days of grinding.

## The "Grandmaster" Grind

Reaching Tier 5 (10,000 Rep) takes about 2 weeks of dedicated play.

**My Daily Routine:**
1. Log in, grab Daily Quests.
2. Check Request Board. If it asks for Armor, I craft it. If it asks for rare drops, I skip.
3. Run one [Dungeon](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide) for the weekly trophy.
4. Spend remaining time [farming gold](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit).

## Final Thoughts

Reputation is the long-term progression bar of The Forge. Don't ignore it.

Start doing your dailies now. When you finally unlock that Private Island, you'll be glad you did.
