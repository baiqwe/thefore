# The Forge (Roblox) Dungeon Guide: Hidden Bosses & Loot Drops

**Ready for the ultimate challenge?**

In **The Forge on Roblox**, Dungeons are where you prove your worth. They contain the toughest enemies, the most complex mechanics, and the only loot that matters for endgame players.

I've cleared every dungeon in the game. Here is your survival guide.

## Dungeon Locations & Requirements

You can't just walk in. You need keys and levels.

| Dungeon | Location | Level Req. | Key Item |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Goblin Caves** | Starter Forest | 10+ | None |
| **Skeleton Crypt** | Graveyard | 25+ | Bone Key |
| **Magma Core** | Volcano | 40+ | Fire Ruby |
| **Ice Palace** | Frozen Peaks | 50+ | Frost Sigil |

> **Note:** The **Magma Core** is where you farm materials for the [Legendary Arcane Pickaxe](/blog/legendary-arcane-pickaxe-guide).

## Hidden Bosses Guide

Most players miss the secret bosses. They spawn only under specific conditions.

### 1. The Shadow Knight (Skeleton Crypt)
**Location:** Behind a breakable wall in the second hallway. Look for a cracked brick.
**Summon:** Light all 4 torches in the room within 10 seconds.
**Loot:** Drops **Shadow Essence** (Used for [Enhancement](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments)).

### 2. The Lava Golem (Magma Core)
**Location:** Jump into the lava pool below the main bridge (use a Fire Resistance potion!).
**Loot:** Drops **Volcanic Core** (Essential for Fire Runes).

---

## Boss Mechanics & Strategy

Tank and spank doesn't work here. You need mechanics.

### The Crypt Lord (Skeleton Crypt Boss)
- **Phase 1:** Summons minions. Ignore boss, kill minions first.
- **Phase 2:** Spins blade. **Run away.** Do not block.
- **Weakness:** Holy/Blunt damage. Bring a Hammer.

### The Magma King (Magma Core Boss)
- **Mechanic:** The floor turns to lava every 30 seconds. Jump on pillars.
- **Weakness:** Ice/Water. Use [Ice Arrows](/blog/ranged-weapons-tactical-guide) to slow him down.

---

## Team Composition

Soloing is possible but hard. For efficient farming, bring a team.

**Ideal 3-Man Squad:**
1. **Tank:** [Heavy Armor](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) user with Shield. Holds aggro.
2. **DPS:** [Katana/Greatsword](/blog/weapon-mastery-katana-greatsword) user. Deals damage.
3. **Support/Ranged:** [Bow/Staff](/blog/ranged-weapons-tactical-guide) user. Kites adds and heals.

> **Race Synergy:** An **Undead** tank is unkillable. A **Dragonborn** DPS melts bosses. See my [Race Guide](/blog/quest-for-dragonborn-bloodline) for details.

## Loot Tables: What Are We Farming?

Why do we do this? For the shiny things.

| Item | Drop Rate | Dungeon | Value |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Enhancement Stones** | Common | All | Essential |
| **Rare Blueprints** | 5% | Crypt/Magma | High |
| **Legendary Weapons** | 0.5% | Magma/Ice | **Priceless** |

If you get a Legendary drop, check the [Trading Guide](/blog/advanced-trading-secrets) before selling. Don't get scammed.

## Preparation Checklist

Before you enter:
1. **Empty Inventory:** You need space for loot. [Manage it](/blog/inventory-management-philosophy).
2. **Potions:** 50x Health, 20x Mana.
3. **Buffs:** Eat food for stat bonuses.
4. **Repair:** Ensure all gear is at 100% durability.
