# The Forge (Roblox) Smelting Guide: Mastering Furnace Temperature

**Is your ore turning into slag?** You're not alone.

In **The Forge on Roblox**, smelting isn't just a progress bar. It's a skill-based mini-game. The difference between a "Perfect" ingot and a "Dross" ingot is huge—it affects your weapon stats, your selling price, and your reputation.

I've smelted over 10,000 ingots. Here is the science behind the heat.

---

## The Temperature Gauge Explained

The gauge is divided into three zones.

| Zone Color | Temperature Range | Result | Effect |
|------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| **Blue** | 0° - 300° | **Dross** | -20% Quality |
| **Yellow** | 300° - 500° | **Perfect** | +15% Quality |
| **Red** | 500°+ | **Slag** | Item Destroyed |

**The Goal:** Keep the needle in the Yellow Zone for the entire duration.

---

## The "Rhythm" Technique

Most players spam click. This is wrong.

**The Correct Method:**
1. **Initial Heat:** Click fast to reach the Yellow Zone.
2. **Maintenance:** Find a steady rhythm (e.g., click... click... click).
3. **Reaction:** If it drops, double click. If it rises, stop for 1 second.

> **Pro Tip:** The gauge has inertia. It doesn't stop moving instantly. You must anticipate the movement.

## Fuel Matters

Your fuel choice changes the difficulty.

| Fuel | Stability | Difficulty | Best For |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Charcoal** | Unstable | Hard | Practice |
| **Coal** | Stable | Normal | General Use |
| **Fire Essence** | Very Stable | Easy | Rare Ores |

See my [Fuel Economics Guide](/blog/furnace-fuel-economics) for cost analysis.

## Advanced Smelting: Alloys

Later in the game, you unlock **Alloys** (mixing two ores).

**Example: Steel (Iron + Coal)**
- Requires **Higher Temperature** (400° - 600°).
- The "Perfect" zone shifts to the right.
- If you use the muscle memory for Iron, you will fail.

**Example: Mithril**
- The "Perfect" zone is tiny.
- Requires **Fire Essence** to even attempt safely.

## Equipment That Helps

You can make smelting easier with gear.

1. **Smith's Gloves:** +10% Temperature Stability. (Buy from [Reputation Shop](/blog/reputation-quests-blueprint-shop)).
2. **Dwarf Race:** Passive bonus to smelting success. (See [Race Guide](/blog/quest-for-dragonborn-bloodline)).
3. **Masterwork Bellows:** Increases heat generation per click.

## Why Quality is King

Why bother with Perfect smelts?

**The Math:**
- 3x Average Ingots = **100 Damage** Sword.
- 3x Perfect Ingots = **145 Damage** Sword.

That 45% difference is the difference between one-shotting a goblin and getting hit back.

If you are [selling Heavy Armor](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit), Perfect quality doubles your profit margin.

## Final Thoughts

Smelting is the heartbeat of The Forge. Master the rhythm, and you master the game.

Stop accepting "Average" results. Aim for perfection.
