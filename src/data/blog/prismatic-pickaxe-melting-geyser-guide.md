# The Forge Roblox: Prismatic Pickaxe Guide & Stats

The Winter Expansion has introduced the single **best harvesting tool** in the game: the **Prismatic Pickaxe**. Hidden deep within the new Frostspire Expanse, this tool is essential for late-game progression, offering stats that eclipse even the Demonic Pickaxe.

However, many players are getting stuck on the cryptic "**Melting the Geyser**" or "Frozen Glacier" obstacle. This guide will clarify the mechanics, show you exactly where to go, and explain why this 2,000,000 Gold investment is worth every coin.

## The "Melting the Geyser" Puzzle Explained

**If you are searching for a torch, a fire spell, or a "Geyser" to melt the ice wall, stop searching.** The community terms "Melting the Geyser" or "Melting the Glacier" are misleading.

The ice block protecting the Prismatic Pickaxe is **not a puzzle**; it is a **Stat Check**.

### To break the ice, you do not need heat; you need raw power.

> **You need at least 320 Mining Power to break the ice.**

If your current pickaxe has less than 320 Power, the ice will simply say "0 Damage" or remain unbreakable.

### The Solution:

Before heading to the location, ensure you purchase the **Snow Pickaxe** from the Winter Merchant.

- **Cost:** 750,000 Gold
- **Power:** Sufficient to break the barrier

> **Pro Tip:** Do not attempt this with the standard Iron or Gold pickaxes; you will just waste your travel time.

## Step-by-Step Location Guide

Once you have the required Mining Power, follow this path to find the hidden vendor:

1. **Travel to Frostspire Expanse:** Enter the new winter biome island.

2. **Find Bjorn's House:** Look for the NPC named Bjorn. His house is a key landmark near the village center.

3. **Locate the Frozen Lake:** Go directly behind Bjorn's house. You will see a small frozen lake.

4. **Enter the Hole:** In the center of the lake, there is a hole in the ice. Jump in and swim down.

5. **Find the Mosasaurus:** At the bottom, you will see a massive frozen prehistoric creature (resembling a Mosasaurus or Whale).

6. **Break the Ice:** Use your 320+ Power pickaxe to break the ice casing near the creature's mouth.

7. **Purchase:** Interact with the sparkling item inside to buy the Prismatic Pickaxe for **2,000,000 Gold**.

## Stats Analysis: Is it Worth It?

The Prismatic Pickaxe is currently the "**Best in Slot**" (BiS) for three reasons, making it superior to the Void or Demonic pickaxes:

### Power Comparison Table

| Pickaxe | Power | Luck | Rune Slots | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|------------|------|
| Demonic Pickaxe | 175 | 47.5% | 3 | Race-locked |
| **Prismatic Pickaxe** | **650** | **72%** | **4** | **2,000,000 Gold** |
| Lightite Pickaxe | 100 | 62% | 2 | 98,500 Gold |

### Why Prismatic is Best:

1. **Mining Power: 650** (Highest in the game, melts high-tier ores)
2. **Luck: +72%** (Crucial for finding Iceite and Archangel rerolls)
3. **Rune Slots: 4 Slots** (The only tool with 4 slots, allowing for massive customization with [Miner Shards](/wiki))

❌ **Don't skip the Snow Pickaxe** - It's a required stepping stone  
✅ **Do bring extra gold** - Travel time is long if you're short on funds
