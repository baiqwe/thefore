# The Forge (Roblox) Fuel Guide: Coal vs. Essences Economics

**Are you burning your profits?**

In **The Forge on Roblox**, fuel is the hidden tax on every item you craft. Most players just throw whatever they have into the furnace.

Big mistake.

Choosing the wrong fuel can wipe out your profit margins. I've crunched the numbers to find the most cost-effective fuel for every situation.

---

## Fuel Types Overview

There are three main fuel sources in the game.

### Fuel Comparison Table

| Fuel Type | Burn Duration | Temperature Stability | Cost | Best For |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|------|----------|
| **Charcoal** | Short | Low (Fluctuates) | Free (Wood) | Beginner Ores |
| **Coal** | Medium | Medium | Cheap | Iron/Steel |
| **Fire Essence** | Long | High (Stable) | Expensive | Rare/Legendary |

## The Economics of Coal

Coal is the workhorse of The Forge.

- **Cost:** ~5 Gold per unit (from merchant)
- **Efficiency:** Smelts 2-3 ingots per piece

**My Strategy:** I buy Coal in bulk (stacks of 999). It's cheap enough that farming it isn't worth my time. I'd rather spend that time [mining valuable ores](/blog/portal-adventure-forgotten-kingdom).

If you are crafting [Heavy Armor for profit](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit), Coal is your best friend. It keeps margins high.

## When to Use Fire Essences

Fire Essences are expensive drops from fire mobs or crafted with magic dust.

**Cost:** ~200 Gold per unit.

**Why use them?**
1. **Temperature Stability:** The gauge moves slower, making it easier to hit "Perfect" smelts.
2. **Burn Time:** Lasts 4x longer than coal.

**The Rule:** Only use Essences for **Mithril, Adamantite, or Arcane Ore**.
Using an Essence to smelt Copper is like lighting a cigar with a $100 bill.

---

## Charcoal: The Trap

Beginners think Charcoal is great because it's "free." You just chop wood and burn it.

**The Reality:**
- Chopping wood takes time and stamina.
- Charcoal burns very fast.
- Temperature fluctuates wildly, causing more failed smelts.

**Verdict:** Avoid Charcoal once you pass the tutorial. Your time is worth more than the cost of Coal.

## Fuel Efficiency Tips

How to stretch your fuel further:

### 1. Batch Smelting
Never light the furnace for one ore.
- Load 50 ore at once.
- Add fuel.
- Smelt continuously.

The furnace takes time to heat up. Batching saves that "warm-up" fuel cost.

### 2. The "Golden Zone" Technique
Maintain the temperature in the [Golden Zone](/blog/furnace-temperature-mastery). Overheating wastes fuel (burn rate increases at max temp).

### 3. Race Bonuses
**Dwarves** have a hidden passive: 10% slower fuel consumption.
If you are a dedicated smelter, this adds up to thousands of gold saved over time. Check my [Race Guide](/blog/quest-for-dragonborn-bloodline) for more details.

## Cost Analysis: 100 Ingot Batch

I ran a test smelting 100 Iron Ingots.

| Fuel Used | Fuel Cost | Failed Smelts | Total Cost |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Charcoal** | 0 (30 min labor) | 12 | High (Time loss) |
| **Coal** | 500 Gold | 4 | **Low (Winner)** |
| **Essence** | 5,000 Gold | 0 | Too High |

**Conclusion:** Coal is the king of general crafting.

## Final Thoughts

Fuel management isn't exciting, but it's the backbone of a profitable smithy.

Switch to Coal. Save your Essences for the big stuff. And stop chopping trees for charcoal—you're a blacksmith, not a lumberjack.
