# The Forge (Roblox) Exploration Guide: Forgotten Kingdom & Portals

**Tired of the starter village?** It's time to step through the portal.

In **The Forge on Roblox**, the real game begins when you leave the safety of the Newbie Mine. The **Forgotten Kingdom** awaits—a high-level zone filled with rare ores, dangerous monsters, and incredible loot.

But be warned: this isn't a vacation. It's a survival test.

---

## How to Unlock Portals

You can't just walk there. You need to rebuild the **Ancient Portal**.

### The Portal Quest
Sensei Moro gives this quest at Level 15. You need to gather:

- 50 Iron Ingots
- 20 Magic Dust
- 1 Void Crystal (Boss drop)

Once repaired, the portal allows instant travel between zones.

> **Pro Tip:** Always carry a **Recall Scroll**. If you get stuck in a high-level zone with broken gear, it's your only way home without dying and losing items.

## Zone Overview: The Forgotten Kingdom

This zone is massive. It's divided into three distinct areas, each with unique resources and threats.

### Zone Comparison Table

| Area | Main Resource | Threat Level | Recommended Level |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Silent Forest** | Hardwood, Herbs | Moderate | 15-25 |
| **Crystal Caverns** | Mithril, Crystals | High | 25-35 |
| **Ruined City** | Ancient Scrap, Artifacts | Extreme | 35+ |

I spent my first hour in the Silent Forest just gathering Hardwood. It sells for 5x the price of normal wood in the [trading market](/blog/advanced-trading-secrets).

## Survival Strategy

The monsters here don't play nice.

### 1. Preparation is Key
Don't enter without:
- Full set of [Heavy Armor](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) (at least +3)
- 20+ Health Potions
- Repair Kits for your tools

### 2. Combat Tactics
Monsters in the Kingdom have elemental weaknesses.

- **Forest Mobs:** Weak to Fire (Use [Ignis Runes](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments))
- **Cavern Mobs:** Weak to Blunt damage (Hammers)
- **City Mobs:** Weak to Holy/Light damage

Check my [Weapon Mastery Guide](/blog/weapon-mastery-katana-greatsword) for the best combat builds.

### 3. The "Hit and Run" Mining Method
Mining here is dangerous.

1. Scout the area for mobs.
2. Clear immediate threats.
3. Mine the node quickly using [stamina management](/blog/my-blacksmith-journey-begins).
4. Move to the next spot immediately.

Do not AFK mine here. You will die.

## The Economics of High-Level Zones

Is it worth the risk? Absolutely.

**Hourly Earnings Comparison:**

| Location | Activity | Gold/Hour | Risk |
|----------|----------|-----------|------|
| Newbie Mine | Copper Mining | 8,000 | Low |
| Iron Caves | Iron Mining | 25,000 | Medium |
| **Forgotten Kingdom** | **Mithril/Artifacts** | **85,000** | **High** |

One hour in the Kingdom equals ten hours in the starter zone.

## Hidden Secrets of the Kingdom

Exploration pays off. I've found several hidden locations that aren't on the map.

### The Merchant's Hideout
Located behind the waterfall in the Silent Forest. This NPC sells rare [crafting blueprints](/blog/reputation-quests-blueprint-shop) that you can't get anywhere else.

### The Ancient Forge
Deep in the Ruined City lies a functional Ancient Forge.
- **Benefit:** +10% success rate on all crafting
- **Risk:** Guarded by a Level 40 Golem

I do all my high-end crafting here now. The risk is worth the bonus.

---

## My "Base Camp" Strategy

Traveling back to town takes time. So I set up a forward operating base.

I use a **Portable Tent** (craftable item) near the entrance of the Crystal Caverns.
- Allows storage of excess ore
- Provides a safe spot to regenerate health
- Saves 20 minutes of travel time per session

Efficient [inventory management](/blog/inventory-management-philosophy) is crucial when you're this far from a shop.

## Final Thoughts

The Forgotten Kingdom is where The Forge transforms from a clicking simulator into a true adventure RPG.

The risks are real, but the rewards are legendary. Gear up, step through the portal, and claim your fortune.
