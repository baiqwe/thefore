# The Forge (Roblox) Inventory Guide: Management & Storage Philosophy

**Is your backpack always full?** You're not alone.

In **The Forge on Roblox**, inventory space is the most valuable resource after Gold. With hundreds of ores, materials, and equipment types, it's easy to become a hoarder.

I used to spend 20% of my playtime just sorting items. Now, I use a strict **Three-Tier System** that keeps my inventory clean and my mind clear.

---

## The Problem: Hoarding Syndrome

We've all done it. "I might need this Rusty Dagger later."

**Spoiler:** You won't.

Hoarding kills your efficiency. If you have to stop [mining](/blog/my-blacksmith-journey-begins) every 5 minutes to delete items, you are losing gold.

---

## My Three-Tier Priority System

I categorize every item in the game into three tiers.

### Tier 1: The Essentials (Always Keep)
These items never leave my inventory.

- **Tools:** Best Pickaxe, Hammer, Weapon
- **Consumables:** 50x Coal, 20x Potions, 5x Repair Kits
- **Valuables:** Gems, Runes, [Essences](/blog/furnace-fuel-economics)

### Tier 2: The Trade Goods (Store or Sell)
Items with value that I don't need immediately.

- **Ores:** Iron, Mithril, Gold
- **Crafting Mats:** Leather, Wood, Flux
- **Blueprints:** Rare recipes

**Action:** Move to Bank/Storage Chest immediately after a run.

### Tier 3: The Junk (Deconstruct/Sell)
Everything else.

- **Low-tier Gear:** Common swords, weak armor
- **Trash Drops:** Slime goo, broken hilts
- **Excess Materials:** Cobblestone (keep 1 stack max)

**Action:** Deconstruct for materials or sell to NPC instantly.

## The Weekly Audit

Every Sunday, I perform a "Warehouse Audit."

1. **Check Storage Chests:** Is it full of junk?
2. **Consolidate Stacks:** Combine split stacks of ore.
3. **Liquidation:** If I haven't used an item in 2 weeks, I sell it on the [trading market](/blog/advanced-trading-secrets).

> **Rule of Thumb:** If you can buy it easily from a merchant for under 100 gold, don't store it. Just buy it when you need it.

## Expanding Your Storage

You start with limited slots. Expanding is a priority.

### Upgrade Path

1. **Backpack Upgrades:** Buy the first 2 upgrades with Gold immediately. They pay for themselves in one [mining run](/blog/portal-adventure-forgotten-kingdom).
2. **Bank Slots:** Expensive but permanent. Worth it for long-term play.
3. **House Storage:** Craft Chests for your player housing.
   - **Wood Chest:** 20 Slots (Cheap)
   - **Iron Chest:** 50 Slots (Best Value)
   - **Magic Chest:** 100 Slots (Endgame)

## Deconstruction vs. Selling

What should you do with unwanted gear?

| Item Type | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Common Gear** | Sell to NPC | Materials returned are worthless |
| **Uncommon/Rare** | **Deconstruct** | Chance for Flux/Dust |
| **Epic+** | Trade/Auction | Too valuable to destroy |

Deconstructing is vital for getting **Enhancement Stones** later in the game. See my [Enhancement Guide](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments) for why these matter.

---

## Organizing for Efficiency

I organize my hotbar for muscle memory.

- **Slot 1:** Main Weapon ([Katana/Greatsword](/blog/weapon-mastery-katana-greatsword))
- **Slot 2:** Pickaxe
- **Slot 3:** Health Potion
- **Slot 4:** Torch/Light
- **Slot 5:** Recall Scroll

This setup saves lives. When a boss jumps you, you don't want to be fumbling for your sword.

## Final Thoughts

A clean inventory is a happy blacksmith.

Stop hoarding broken swords. Adopt a system. Spend less time sorting and more time forging.
