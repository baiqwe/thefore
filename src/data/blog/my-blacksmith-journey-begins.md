# The Forge (Roblox) Beginner's Guide: Mining & Smelting Tutorial

**New to The Forge?** This guide covers everything you need to start your blacksmith journey in **The Forge on Roblox**.

When I first played this game, I was completely lost. The tutorial barely scratches the surface. After 100+ hours, I've learned the systems inside and out. Here's what actually works.

## Getting Started: Meeting Sensei Moro

Your first task is finding **Sensei Moro** in the starter village. He's the old man in dark robes at the center. Talk to him and accept the "Learn to Mine" quest. This unlocks the core game systems you'll use throughout the game.

## Mining Basics: Understanding Stamina

The game's mining system revolves around **stamina management**. Every pickaxe swing costs stamina. Run out? Your mining speed drops to almost nothing.

### Two Attack Types

You have two options:

- **Normal Attack** (left-click): Slow speed, no stamina cost
- **Quick Attack** (hold key): Fast speed, high stamina drain

### Optimal Mining Strategy

Here's the winning approach:

1. Use quick attacks until ore reaches 50% health
2. Switch to normal attacks while stamina recovers
3. Finish with quick attacks for final damage

This technique makes you 3x faster than random button-mashing.

### Hidden Stamina Mechanic

Your stamina recovery rate changes based on current activity:

- **Standing still**: Fast recovery (100% rate)
- **Walking**: Medium recovery (60% rate)  
- **Fighting**: Slow recovery (30% rate)

> **Pro Tip:** Plant yourself at ore veins and mine everything nearby before moving. Walking around searching wastes time.

For advanced mining strategies, check the [Arcane Pickaxe Guide](/blog/legendary-arcane-pickaxe-guide).

## Smelting: The Temperature Mini-Game

After mining ore, you'll smelt it into ingots. Throw ore in the furnace, pump the bellows, and keep temperature in the **yellow zone**.

### Temperature Zones

| Zone | Result | What Happens |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Blue | Dross | Creates unusable slag |
| Yellow | Pure Ingot | Perfect quality result |
| Red | Slag | Ore burns completely |

### Common Mistakes

Understanding what causes failures:

- Clicking too fast leads to red zone, which burns the ore
- Stopping too long leads to blue zone, which creates dross
- Inconsistent rhythm leads to poor results overall

### The Solution

Find a steady clicking rhythm. Consistency beats speed every time.

> **Important:** The temperature gauge has 0.15 second input delay. Click slightly before you think you need to, not when you see the temperature dropping.

For mastery techniques, read the [Temperature Mastery Guide](/blog/furnace-temperature-mastery).

### Why Quality Matters

Perfect smelting isn't just 10% better. The quality compounds when using multiple ingots. A sword crafted from three perfect ingots is **30-40% stronger** than one made from average ingots. Always aim for perfect quality.

## Forging Your First Weapon (The Weight System)

Place ingots on the anvil. **Note:** The game now uses a **Weight System**. The number of ores you use determines the weapon type.

### Understanding Weight Thresholds

- **1-5 Ores:** Dagger (Very Fast)
- **6-15 Ores:** Katana / Rapier (Fast)
- **16-29 Ores:** Greatsword / Axe (Heavy)
- **30+ Ores:** Colossal Sword (Massive Damage)

**Recommendation:** Start with a **Katana (6-10 ores)**. It's the best balance of speed and cost for beginners.

### The Forging Minigame

You'll see two circles on screen:

- One shrinking circle (moving target)
- One fixed circle (stationary goal)

Click when they perfectly overlap. Each "Perfect Strike" upgrades the weapon's final Tier.

### Quality Tiers

| Quality | Color | Bonus | Difficulty |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Common | White | 0% | Easy |
| Uncommon | Blue | +15% | Medium |
| Rare | Green | +30% | Hard |
| Epic | Purple | +50% | Very Hard |
| Legendary | Gold | +75% | Expert Level |

My first **Rare pickaxe** doubled my mining speed instantly. For equipment optimization tips, see the [Enhancement Guide](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments).

## Critical Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rushing to Hard Areas

After crafting my first rare pickaxe, I immediately rushed to deep mines. The result was getting destroyed and losing everything.

**Lesson learned:** Better gear doesn't mean invincibility. Progress gradually through difficulty levels.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Durability

Your tools have durability that decreases with use. Let them break completely? You're stuck with the basic wooden starter pick again.

**Solution:** Repair tools when durability reaches 20%.

### Mistake 3: Solo Smelting

Smelting one ore at a time prevents you from developing rhythm and consistency.

**Better approach:**

1. Collect 10+ ores before starting
2. Do a focused batch session
3. You'll hit flow state around ore 3-5
4. Success rate jumps from 40% to 75%

## What Actually Determines Success

After 100+ hours of gameplay, here's what truly matters:

| Factor | Impact on Power | Your Action |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Weapon Quality | 40% | Invest in better tools first |
| Player Skill | 30% | Master combat mechanics |
| Equipment & Upgrades | 20% | Use enhancement system |
| Race Stats | 10% | Choose based on playstyle |

Race selection is the smallest factor. Master core mechanics first.
