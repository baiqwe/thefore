# The Forge (Roblox) Trading Guide: Market Flipping & Secrets

**Why grind for gold when you can let your money work for you?**

In **The Forge on Roblox**, the richest players aren't the ones mining all day. They are the traders.

I went from 10,000 gold to 10 Million gold in one month without swinging a pickaxe. Here is how I mastered the market.

## The Basics of Value

Price is determined by **Supply and Demand**.

- **Supply:** How hard is it to get? (Rarity, Drop Rate)
- **Demand:** How many players need it? (Meta builds, Quests)

### Example: The Fire Ruby
- **Supply:** Low (Rare drop from [Magma Boss](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide)).
- **Demand:** High (Required for Magma Key).
- **Result:** High Price.

## Strategy 1: The "Buy Low, Sell High" Flip

This is the oldest trick in the book, but it works.

**The Method:**
1. Hang out in the Trade Hub.
2. Look for players selling items quickly ("Selling fast, cheap!").
3. Buy their item for 20-30% below market value.
4. List it on your shop or trade chat for full market value.

> **Real Example:** I bought a **Volcanic Rune** for 50k from a desperate player. Sold it 2 hours later for 85k. Profit: 35k for doing nothing.

## Strategy 2: Update Speculation

This is where the big money is.

**How it works:**
1. Read the game's update patch notes or leaks.
2. Predict what items will become useful.
3. Buy them NOW while they are cheap.
4. Sell when the update drops.

**Case Study:**
Devs announced a new "Ice Dungeon."
- I bought 1,000 **Fire Essences** (because Fire beats Ice).
- Price was 100g each.
- Update dropped. Everyone needed Fire Essences.
- Price spiked to 500g each.
- **Profit:** 400,000 Gold.

## Strategy 3: The Crafter's Edge

Buy raw materials, craft finished goods, sell for profit.

Most players are lazy. They will sell raw ore cheap and buy finished armor expensive.

- **Buy:** 100 Iron Ore + Coal.
- **Action:** Smelt and Craft [Heavy Armor](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit).
- **Sell:** Full Armor Set.
- **Margin:** Usually 50-100% profit.

This requires [Furnace Mastery](/blog/furnace-temperature-mastery) to ensure high quality.

## Avoiding Scams

The market is full of sharks. Don't get bitten.

### Common Scams
1. **The Switch:** They put in a Legendary item, then quickly switch it to a Common one that looks similar. **Always check before clicking Accept.**
2. **The "Trust" Game:** "Let me borrow it to test damage." **Never.**
3. **Inflated Value:** "This rare item is worth 1M!" (It's actually worth 10k). **Check recent sales history.**

---

## Market Trends & Timing

Prices fluctuate daily.

- **Friday Night:** Prices go UP (More buyers online). **Sell time.**
- **Monday Morning:** Prices go DOWN (Weekend farming supply hits market). **Buy time.**

I do all my shopping on Mondays and all my selling on Fridays.

## What to Invest In Now

Based on current meta:

1. **Legendary Pickaxes:** Always in demand. See [Arcane Pickaxe Guide](/blog/legendary-arcane-pickaxe-guide).
2. **Enhancement Stones:** Consumables are always needed. See [Enhancement Guide](/blog/enhancement-and-rune-experiments).
3. **Ancient Runes:** High-end players pay millions for perfect rolls.

## Final Thoughts

Trading is a game within a game. It requires patience, knowledge, and guts.

Start small. Flip some iron ore. Learn the prices. Before you know it, you'll own the market.
