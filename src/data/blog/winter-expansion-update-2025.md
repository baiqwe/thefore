# The Forge Winter Update: Archangel Race, Snowite Ore, and New Map

The Christmas 2025 update for The Forge is finally here, and it's **massive**. From the freezing peaks of the **Frostspire Expanse** to the game-breaking **Archangel race**, the meta has completely shifted.

Whether you are looking for the new ore multipliers or trying to figure out how to complete Sensei Moro's new quest, this breakdown covers everything you need to know about the Winter Expansion.

---

## New Ores: Snowite vs. Iceite

The update introduces **winter-exclusive ores** found only in the Frostspire Expanse. Understanding their stats is key to crafting the new "Meta" weapons.

### Ore Comparison Table

| Ore | Rarity | Multiplier | Drop Rate | Trait | Best Use |
|-----|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Galaxite | Divine | 8.0x | 1/5,000 | Cosmic Power | Boss farming |
| **Snowite** | **Legendary** | **8.0x** | **1/4,000** | **Snow (Slow)** | **PVP/Kiting** |
| **Iceite** | **Mythical** | **10.5x** | **1/9,898** | **Ice (Freeze)** | **Highest DPS** |

### Snowite (Legendary)

- **Multiplier:** 8.0x (Tied with Galaxite)
- **Rarity:** ~1 in 4,000
- **Trait - "Snow":** What does snowite do? It is a **PVP-focused ore**. Weapons crafted with Snowite have a **30% chance to slow down enemy attack speed and movement by 15%**. This is excellent for kiting bosses like the Yeti.

### Iceite (Mythical)

- **Multiplier:** 10.5x (Currently the **highest in the game**)
- **Rarity:** ~1 in 10,000
- **Trait - "Ice":** Grants a **25% chance to completely Freeze enemies for 2 seconds**.

> **Pro Tip:** Iceite is the new BiS (Best in Slot) ore for damage. If you're farming for it, make sure you have the [Prismatic Pickaxe](/blog/prismatic-pickaxe-melting-geyser-guide) with 72% Luck.

## The Archangel Race: Why It's Overpowered

The community is already calling **Archangel** the **best race** in The Forge, and the data backs it up. It is a "Secret" rarity race with a roll chance of **0.1%**.

### Key Abilities

| Ability | Effect | Why It's OP |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Wings** | +75% Dash Distance, -25% Dash CD, +30% Jump Height, I-Frames | Best mobility in game |
| **Divine Beam** | 33% chance to smite enemies with holy light | High damage proc |
| **Holy Circle** | Area DoT that damages nearby enemies | Passive AoE farming |
| **Hybrid Stats** | Combines Demon damage with Angel mobility | No weaknesses |

### Race Tier Ranking (Post-Winter Update)

1. **Archangel** (S+) - 0.1% - Hybrid perfection
2. Angel (S) - 0.5% - Still top-tier mobility
3. Demon (S) - 0.5% - Highest raw DPS
4. Minotaur (A) - 1.25% - Best tank
5. Dwarf (B) - 8% - Mining specialist

> **Note:** You will likely need a significant amount of **Rerolls** to get Archangel. Check our [Codes page](/codes) for the latest XMAS! code (5x rerolls).

## Quick Guide: Sensei Moro Quest 6

Many players are stuck on **Sensei Moro 6**, specifically the requirement to mine **Basalt Veins**.

### Solution:

**Location:** Basalt Veins are ONLY found at the **very bottom of the Volcanic Depths**.

**Strategy:** You do not need to fight the mobs. Use a fast race (like Angel or Rabbit) to run past the Reapers and Pyromancers.

**Tip:** Look for the **glowing red cracks** in the floor; those are the Basalt nodes. You need **5 of them** to progress.

### Step-by-Step:

1. Equip your fastest movement race (Angel recommended)
2. Travel to Volcanic Depths entrance
3. Sprint/dash through all enemy zones (don't fight)
4. Descend to the absolute bottom layer
5. Mine 5 Basalt Veins (glowing red floor cracks)
6. Return to Sensei Moro to complete

## Tips for New Players

If you're just starting the Winter Expansion:

✅ **Do:**
- Redeem all active codes first (especially **XMAS!** and **HEART**)
- Complete story quests to unlock Frostspire Expanse
- Save gold for Snow Pickaxe before attempting Prismatic Pickaxe
- Join a server with fewer players for better ore spawns

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush to Yeti Summit without proper gear (you'll die)
- Waste rerolls before understanding race mechanics
- Sell Snowite/Iceite (they're for crafting, not selling)
- Attempt Mosasaurus puzzle without 320+ Mining Power
