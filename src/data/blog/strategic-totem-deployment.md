# The Forge (Roblox) Automation Guide: Strategic Totem Deployment

**Want to mine while you sleep?** You need Totems.

In **The Forge on Roblox**, Totems are your automated workforce. They mine resources for you, 24/7. But simply placing them down isn't enough. You need a strategy.

I've optimized my totem farm to generate 50,000 gold worth of ore every day—without me clicking a single button.

## How Totems Work

A Totem automatically mines any resource node within its range.

- **Range:** Usually 3x3 or 5x5 area.
- **Speed:** Slower than a player, but never gets tired.
- **Storage:** Has internal inventory. Stops working when full.

### Totem Types

| Totem | Resource | Crafting Cost | Profit Potential |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Stone Totem** | Stone/Coal | Low | Low |
| **Iron Totem** | Iron Ore | Medium | Medium |
| **Crystal Totem** | Gems/Crystals | High | **Very High** |
| **Universal Totem** | Anything | Extreme | **God Tier** |

## Placement Strategy: The "Flower Pattern"

Don't place totems randomly. Use the **Flower Pattern** for maximum efficiency.

1. **Center:** Place a Large Storage Chest.
2. **Surround:** Place 4-8 Totems around the chest.
3. **Connect:** Use Conveyor Belts (if available) or manual transfer.

This setup ensures totems never stop working because their internal storage fills up. They dump into the large chest instead.

> **Note:** You need to unlock items from the [Advanced Mold Shop](/blog/reputation-quests-blueprint-shop) to build advanced storage.

## The Economics of Automation

Totems are an investment.

**Iron Totem Cost:**
- 50 Iron Ores (Refined)
- 10 Electronics
- **Total Value:** ~2,000 Gold

**Return on Investment (ROI):**
- Mines ~200 Iron Ore per day.
- Value: ~4,000 Gold.
- **Payback Period:** 12 hours.

After 12 hours, everything is pure profit. It's a no-brainer.

## Best Locations for Totem Farms

Location matters. You can't move resource nodes, so you must build where the resources are.

### 1. The Iron Loop (Iron Caves)
Find the circular room in the Iron Caves. It has 8 Iron nodes in a tight circle. Perfect for a central chest setup.

### 2. The Crystal Corner (Forgotten Kingdom)
In the [Crystal Caverns](/blog/portal-adventure-forgotten-kingdom), there is a safe corner with 3 Mithril nodes. Guard it well or build walls.

### 3. Private Island (Housing)
Eventually, you can buy a Private Island. This is the ultimate goal. You can spawn resource nodes here and build a massive, safe factory.

## Maintenance & Defense

Totems can be attacked by mobs (in public zones).

**Defense Strategy:**
1. Build **Walls** around your farm.
2. Place **Turrets** (Engineer class) if possible.
3. Check it every few hours.

If you are AFK farming, make sure your character is safe from [dungeon bosses](/blog/dungeon-hidden-bosses-guide) that might roam nearby.

## Advanced: Totem Synergies

Some items boost totem speed.

- **Oiler:** Increases speed by 20%. Requires fuel ([Coal](/blog/furnace-fuel-economics)).
- **Conveyor:** Moves items to furnaces automatically.

**The Dream Setup:**
Totem -> Conveyor -> Auto-Furnace -> Storage Chest.

This turns raw ore directly into ingots while you sleep. It's the ultimate [Heavy Armor profit](/blog/heavy-armor-crafting-for-profit) machine.

## Final Thoughts

Totems change the game from a clicker to a management sim.

Start small. Build one Iron Totem. Reinvest the profits to build another. Soon, you'll have an industrial empire.

**How many totems do you run?** Let me know in the comments!
