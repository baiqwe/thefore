Don't assume the quest marker is pointing to the exact location - it only shows the general area. Also, make sure you've actually accepted the quest from Tomo - you can't find the cat without the quest active."

This quest serves as an excellent introduction to The Forge's exploration-based gameplay, preparing you for more complex quests like the Arcane Pickaxe quest."
