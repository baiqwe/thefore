Search for a hidden hole in a bush near this NPC (look for a small opening behind the bush, slightly to the left). Enter the hole to find the guitar. Return it to the Bard to receive the Unknown Key. Next, locate the Fallen Angel's Cave entrance (it's a locked door near the spawn area, marked with ancient runes). Use the Unknown Key to unlock the cave. Inside, navigate through the cave (watch out for falling rocks) until you reach the inner chamber. The Arcane Pickaxe is displayed on a pedestal in the center. This pickaxe is essential for mining at depths above 400m and provides a massive advantage for gathering rare ores like Mithril, Demonite, and Luminite.",

First, you must have the Arcane Pickaxe and reach maximum mining depth (1000-1200 meters). Luminite ore is extremely rare and only spawns at these extreme depths. You'll need 15 Luminite Ingots total. Mining Luminite requires patience - it spawns in single-ore nodes, so you'll need to mine 15 separate nodes. Each node takes approximately 30-45 seconds to mine even with the Arcane Pickaxe. After gathering 15 Luminite Ore, smelt them into ingots at the furnace. Next, visit the Anvil and select 'Colossal Sword'. The forging minigame for this weapon is the most difficult - you must achieve flawless execution (zero timing error) on all three steps to create the weapon. Practice with cheaper materials first (Iron, Gold) to master the timing.

The ore appears as dark purple/black crystalline formations embedded in the walls. Look for clusters of 2-3 ores together - they're easier to spot in well-lit areas. Mining each ore takes approximately 20-30 seconds with the Arcane Pickaxe. Pro tip: Bring extra Coal for smelting, as you'll want to convert ores to ingots immediately to save inventory space. Demonite is essential for crafting the Demonite Axe, one of the most powerful weapons in the game.
